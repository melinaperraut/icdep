<h1> Extension: How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality? </h1>

<p>
  To add additional protocol features without breaking previous functionality, I would encase each of the index cards in an envelope that includes the metadata needed to achieve the specified goal. I would also expand the node/communication network by making the nodes mobile instead of stationary and providing them with any resources needed to connect to one another.
</p>

<p>
  For the <b>first</b> consideration of sending a message to any individual on the whole UW campus: the index card's envelope would contain both the sender's address and the recipient's address so that each node would be aware of the intended destination. Since the network nodes are now mobile, any node could move through campus as needed to connect to the next node and ensure that the message reaches its final recipient. The node would also have the ability to utilize resources such as a bike or bus to speed their travel across long distances and circumvent any obstacles.
</p>

<p>
  For the <b>second</b> consideration of specifying whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values: the index card's envelope would contain a line labeled "content type" (or something similar) that would specify the text type of the card's contents. Because the envelope encases the index card, the recipient would be able to figure out the message type without seeing it.
</p>

<p>
  For the <b>third</b> consideration of keeping a record of what nodes the card has passed through: the index card's envelope would contain a line labeled "nodes visited" (or something similar) that would list values representing the identity of each node the card has visited. Once the card has been received by a node, the node's ID (such as a unique identifying number) will be added to this list.
</p>

<p>
  With the above specifications, my extension mechanism should allow for any kind of extension to our ICDEP system.
